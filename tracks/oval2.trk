This is a track definition file.  The computer will only read the above 
lines, so any kind of commentary can go down here. 
The arrangement above is: 
 
 NSEG - the number of track segments 
 X_MAX  Y_MAX - the maximum value of X that needs to be displayed, 
                feet.  (followed by the same for Y) 
 width - width of race course, feet 
 
 TRK_STRT_X     TRK_STRT_Y    - coordinates of outer rail starting point, feet 
 SCORE_BOARD_X  SCORE_BOARD_Y - coordinates of scoreboard upper left corner 
 LDR_BRD_X      LDR_BRD_Y     - coordinates of leader board upper left corner 
 LOTIX          LOTIY         - coordinates of start of track length message 
 FINISH                       - fraction of 1st segment prior to finish line 
 
 radius        length         - NSEG repetitions of segment radius, length: 
 radius        length         - (0 radius means a straightaway, with length 
 radius        length         -  in feet.  Length of curves is in radians.)
