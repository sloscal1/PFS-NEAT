/**
 * This package contains an implementation of the RARS environment <a>http://sourceforge.net/rars)</a>
 * translated from C/C++ to the Java language.  This was done to allow for more rapid policy evaluation
 * in RL problems.
 * <br />
 *  SimpleRars is the actual problem environment, and all other classes in this package provide support
 *  for that environment. Additional features are controlled within the SimpleRars class, and descriptions
 *  of properties file options are also contained in that class.
 *  <br />
 *  The code is as direct a translation from C as was feasible, and therefore may not be optimized for
 *  the Java language.
