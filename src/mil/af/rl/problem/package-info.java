/**
 * This package defines the problem domain interface that we use between NEAT and our 
 * experimental domains. <code>DoublePoleBalance</code> is an implementation of the standard 
 * double inverted pendulum problem, and the sub-packge <code>rars</code> contains the SimpleRars
 * class, an implementation of the Robot Auto Racing Simulation environment.  Note that there are some
 * over-complicated method call sequences happening in RLProblem. It exists to support other
 * experiments that are not part of this effort.
